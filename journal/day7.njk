  The TransAtlanticWay is a one stage self-supported road bike ride
  between Dublin and Cork via The Wild Atlantic Way. A choice of two
  routes: Cu Culhainn – 2500kms and Sedanta – 1700kms with the pounding
  swell of the Atlantic as your constant companion, you follow the blue
  zig-zag signposts through seven of Ireland’s westernmost counties and
  be treated to many of Ireland’s scenic showstoppers, welcoming towns
  and villages, heritage sites and plenty of unexpected thrills.
