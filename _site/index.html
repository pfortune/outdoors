<p>
  Welcome to my website dedicated to ultraendurance cycling and my experience
  participating in the TransAtlanticWay race. I have always been drawn to the
  toughest and most rewarding challenges in the world of endurance sports, and
  the TransAtlanticWay race is a prime example of this. Covering an epic 1687km
  from Derry to Cork along some of Ireland's most scenic and remote landscapes,
  it was an unforgettable experience.
</p>
<p>
  On this website, I share my experiences of participating in the
  TransAtlanticWay race, including insights into the preparation, training, and
  gear required for such an epic undertaking. I also provide information and
  resources for anyone interested in learning more about ultraendurance cycling,
  bikepacking, or the TransAtlanticWay race itself.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you're a seasoned endurance athlete or simply curious about the world
  of ultraendurance cycling, I invite you to explore my site and discover the
  unique thrills and challenges of this incredible sport.
