<p>
  Welcome to my website dedicated to my experience participating in the TransAtlanticWay ultra-endurance 
  cycling race. Covering 1687km from Derry to Cork along some of Ireland's most scenic and remote landscapes,
  this race was an unforgettable journey that tested me both physically and mentally.
</p>
<p>
  On this website, I share my personal insights and reflections on participating in the TransAtlanticWay 
  race, including a detailed gear list of what I brought, how I trained, and what I learned along the way. 
  I also provide a comprehensive overview of the race itself, including the route, logistics, and rules of 
  the event.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you're a seasoned endurance athlete looking for inspiration, or simply curious about the world 
  of ultra-endurance cycling, I invite you to explore my site and discover the unique thrills and challenges 
  of this incredible sport.
