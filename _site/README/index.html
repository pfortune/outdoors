<p>Outdoor Blog</p>
<p>Readme:
The website is a journal of my experience participating in the TransAtlanticWay, a 1687km cycling race with 19000m of elevation gain. It includes information about the race route, a gear list, journal, and a gallery of photos.</p>
<p>Text Content:
The content for the Route page was sourced from:</p>
<p>• https://www.transatlanticway.com/</p>
<p>Images/Videos:
The logo was generated using an AI image generator called Midjourney. I gave it my own prompts and it created the logo.
All the images/videos on the website otherwise were taken by me or are taken by photographers during the race. I’ve referenced them on the Gallery page.</p>

<p>Font:
Gill Sans was chosen as the font for its clean and legible design, which complements the website's focus on cycling and adventure. Additionally, Gill Sans has a history of use in vintage posters promoting outdoor activities, such as cycling, hiking, and travel. This adds a sense of nostalgia and reinforces the theme of adventure on the website.</p>
