          The TransAtlanticWay is a one stage self-supported road bike ride
          between Dublin and Cork via The Wild Atlantic Way. A choice of two
          routes: Cu Culhainn – 2500kms and Sedanta – 1700kms with the pounding
          swell of the Atlantic as your constant companion, you follow the blue
          zig-zag signposts through seven of Ireland’s westernmost counties and
          be treated to many of Ireland’s scenic showstoppers, welcoming towns
          and villages, heritage sites and plenty of unexpected thrills.
        </p>

          During the ride all responsibility lies with you, to be totally
          self-sufficient. We will help with logistics by offering a bag and/or
          bike box drop at the start, and transfer of bags to the finish.
        </p>

<p>
          All riders will be given and required to carry a gps tracker which
          will enable friends, family and the ride organiser to follow your
          progress and will be used to validate your time and route. The ride
          will be split into two categories: Solo and Pairs.
